# Machine Learning Basics

This repository contains fundamental implementations of various machine learning concepts. The aim is to provide a concise and practical understanding of key ML techniques using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, and TensorFlow.

## Folder Structure

### Python-for-Data-Analysis-NumPy
NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for multi-dimensional arrays, mathematical operations, and efficient data processing. This module covers array creation, slicing, broadcasting, and vectorized operations that significantly speed up computation.

### Python-for-Data-Analysis-Pandas
Pandas is a data manipulation and analysis library. It provides DataFrame and Series structures to handle structured data efficiently. This module includes techniques for data indexing, filtering, grouping, and performing essential statistical operations.

### Pandas-Exercises
A collection of exercises to strengthen Pandas skills, including real-world data cleaning, merging, and aggregation techniques. This helps in mastering data wrangling before diving into machine learning.

### Data-Visualization-with-Matplotlib
Matplotlib is a fundamental plotting library that allows creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python. This module covers different types of plots, annotations, and figure customization for effective data storytelling.

### Data-Visualization-with-Seaborn
Seaborn is a high-level statistical visualization library built on Matplotlib. It simplifies complex plots, such as correlation heatmaps, violin plots, and pair plots, making exploratory data analysis more efficient and visually appealing.

### Pandas-Built-in-Data-Viz
Pandas has built-in data visualization capabilities using Matplotlib as the backend. This module demonstrates quick visualization techniques directly from Pandas DataFrames without requiring additional libraries.

### Plotly-and-Cufflinks
Plotly is an interactive visualization library, and Cufflinks bridges it with Pandas. This module focuses on creating dynamic and web-based visualizations that allow zooming, panning, and hover effects for better data exploration.

### Geographical-Plotting
Geographical visualization is crucial for location-based data analysis. This module explores techniques using Plotly and Folium to create maps, choropleths, and heatmaps to analyze spatial data trends.

### Data-Capstone-Projects
A collection of real-world projects that apply data analysis, visualization, and modeling techniques. These projects serve as practical exercises to integrate multiple concepts learned in previous modules.

### Linear-Regression
Linear regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in machine learning. This module covers simple and multiple linear regression, implementation using Scikit-Learn, and model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².

### Logistic-Regression
Logistic regression is used for classification problems. It predicts categorical outcomes based on independent variables. This module includes concepts like sigmoid function, decision boundaries, and performance evaluation techniques.

### K-Nearest-Neighbors
k-NN is a simple yet powerful classification algorithm that classifies data points based on their nearest neighbors. This module explains its working mechanism, implementation, and tuning of hyperparameters for optimal results.

### Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests
Decision trees are intuitive models that split data based on feature importance. Random forests enhance decision trees by combining multiple trees for improved accuracy and generalization. This module covers both concepts along with practical implementations.

### Support-Vector-Machines
SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate different classes. This module covers linear and non-linear SVMs using kernel tricks, along with implementation using Scikit-Learn.

### K-Means-Clustering
k-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering similar data points together. This module covers centroid initialization techniques, elbow method for selecting k, and practical applications of clustering.

### Principal-Component-Analysis
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps in reducing the number of features while retaining important information. This module explains variance maximization, eigenvectors, and practical implementation for handling high-dimensional data.

### Recommender-Systems
Recommender systems suggest products, movies, or content based on user behavior. This module covers collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid recommendation approaches.

### Natural-Language-Processing
NLP deals with analyzing and understanding human language. This module covers text preprocessing, tokenization, sentiment analysis, vectorization techniques (TF-IDF, Word2Vec), and applications like chatbots and text summarization.

## Installation
To use this repository, clone it and install the required dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arjob-Das/Machine-Learning-Basics.git
cd Machine-Learning-Basics
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Each concept is demonstrated in separate .py files (mostly). Some portions have been commented out (to prevent cluttering of plots. Uncomment to view each plot and analyse them. 
Only a few have been done in notebooks.
